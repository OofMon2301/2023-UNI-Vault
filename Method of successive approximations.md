## 2.1 A modified theorem

To start, we note that it is always possible to apply a variable shift so that the initial value problem can be written as
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y), \quad y(0)=0.
$$
### 2.1.1 Example
$$
y'=2(x-1)(y-1),y(1) =2
$$
```ad-question
title: Solution
Set $\bar{x}=x-1$ and $\bar{y} = y-2$ and the check for
