# Existence and Uniqueness Criteria

Here we consider the initial value theorem of the form
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y), \quad y(x_{0}) = y_{0}
$$
The main result concerns the conditions under which we have existence and uniqueness of a solutions.

```ad-note
If $f$ and $f_y$ are continuous in some rectangle
$$R = \{(x,y) \mid |x-x_{0}| \leq a, \, |y-y_{0}| \leq b\}$$
then there is some interval in which it contains a unique solution $y= \phi(x)$ of the initial value problem
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y), \quad y(x_{0})=y_{0}$$
```
