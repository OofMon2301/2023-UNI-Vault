# Capacitors and Capacitance

A **capacitor** is a device that stores electrical charge and energy in the form of an electric field. It consists of two conductors or electrodes separated by an insulating material.

## Capacitance
[[Capacitance]] $C$ is a measure of the amount of charge $Q$ stored on the capacitor for a given potential difference $\Delta V$ between the electrodes:

$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$

The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F), where 1 F = 1 C/V. Typical capacitors range from picofarads (pF) to microfarads (Î¼F).

For a parallel plate capacitor with plate area $A$ and separation $d$ in a medium with permittivity $\epsilon$, the capacitance is:

$$C = \epsilon \frac{A}{d}$$

## Capacitors in Series and Parallel
When capacitors are connected in **series**, the overall capacitance $C_\text{series}$ is given by:

$$\frac{1}{C_\text{series}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{C_n}$$

For capacitors in **parallel**, the total capacitance $C_\text{parallel}$ is the sum of the individual capacitances:

$$C_\text{parallel} = C_1 + C_2 + \ldots + C_n$$

## Energy Stored in a Capacitor
The energy $U$ stored in a charged capacitor is given by:

$$U = \frac{1}{2}C(\Delta V)^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}$$

For a parallel plate capacitor with uniform electric field $\vec{E}$, the energy density $u$ (energy per unit volume) is:

$$u = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0 E^2$$

This shows that the energy density in an electrostatic field is proportional to the square of the electric field strength.

## Applications
Capacitors are essential components in many electronic circuits and devices, serving functions such as energy storage, filtering, timing, and more. Understanding capacitance and the behaviour of capacitors is crucial in electronics, electrical engineering, and the study of electrostatics.
