# Electric Dipoles

## Elementary Definition
---
Point particles with electric charge are referred to as [[Point Charges|point charges]]. Two point charges, one with charge $+q$ and the other one with charge $-q$ separated by a distance $d$, constitute with an *electric dipole*. For this case, the electric dipole moment has a [[Magnitude|magnitude]]
$$
p=qd
$$
and is directed from the negative charge to the positive one.

A stronger mathematical definition is to use [[Vector|vector]], since a quantity with [[Magnitude|magnitude]] and direction, like the dipole moment of two point charges, can be expressed in vector form
$$
\mathbf{p} = q\mathbf{d}
$$
where $\mathbf{d}$ if the displacement vector pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge. The electric dipole moment vector $\mathbf{p}$ also points from the negative charge to the positive charge.

An **electric dipole** is a pair of equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance $d$. Dipoles are characterized by their **dipole moment vector** $\vec{p} = q\vec{d}$, which points from the negative to the positive charge, with magnitude equal to the charge $q$ times the separation distance $d$. 

## Motion in Electric Fields
In a uniform external electric field $\vec{E}$, a dipole experiences a **torque** tending to align it with the field direction, but no net force on its center of mass. The magnitude of this aligning torque is given by:

$$\tau = |\vec{p} \times \vec{E}| = pE \sin \theta$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between the dipole moment $\vec{p}$ and the field $\vec{E}$. The torque direction is given by the vector $\vec{p} \times \vec{E}$ using the right-hand rule.

In a *non-uniform* field, in addition to the aligning torque, the dipole also experiences a net force $\vec{F}$ towards the region of stronger field. This occurs because the forces on the two charges are unequal in a non-uniform field. The dipole accelerates in the direction where the field is most concentrated or intense.

## Induced Dipole Formation
Neutral atoms and molecules can form **induced dipoles** when placed in an external electric field. The field exerts forces on the nucleus and electron cloud, causing the electrons to shift and creating a dipole moment pointing from the electrons' displaced center of mass towards the positive nucleus. The magnitude of the induced dipole moment depends on the field strength.

## Dipole Electric Field
Once formed, a dipole itself generates an electric field pattern. This **dipole field** arises from the vector sum of the fields from the positive and negative charges. At points far away from the dipole (distances $r >> d$), the dipole field falls off as $1/r^3$, faster than the $1/r^2$ field from a point charge. This faster dropoff occurs because the dipole is electrically neutral overall.

The dipole field at large distances can be approximated as:

$$\vec{E} = k\frac{\vec{p}}{r^3}$$

Where $k$ is the Coulomb constant, $\vec{p}$ is the dipole moment vector, and $r$ is the distance from the dipole center. This expression shows the $1/r^3$ dependence as well as the dipole field direction along $\vec{p}$.

## Applications
Electric dipoles and their behavior in fields are fundamentally important concepts across science, finding applications in physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and electrical engineering. Understanding dipoles is key to topics like polarization, dielectrics, molecular bonds, van der Waals forces, ferroelectrics, and more.
