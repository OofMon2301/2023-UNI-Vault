#ELEC2300s

The magnetic field $\vec{B}_{point \, charge}$ created by a moving point charge $q$ is described by the Biot-Savart law:
$$
\vec{B}_{point \, charge } = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \frac{q\vec{v}\times \hat{r}}{r^{2}}
$$
where $\mu_{0}=4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ $Tm/A$ is the permeability constant, $r$ is the distance from the charge and $\hat{r}$ is a unit vector that points from the charge to the point where we want to calculate the field.

# Question 1.1 - Multiple Choice
In order to produce the same magnetic fields, positively and negatively charged particles would need to:

1. Travel in opposite directions
2. Travel in the same direction
3. Change one of their charges, otherwise it isn't possible.

Answer: Travel in the opposite direction (1).


# 2 | Magnetic Field of a Current

The magnetic field of a current-carrying wire builds on the idea of the moving charge. In this context, it is useful to adapt the Biot-Sawart law to 

$$
\vec{B}_{current ,\ segment} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \frac{q\vec{v}\times \hat{r}}{r^{2}}
$$
The magnetic field due to the whole wire we can calculate by using the principle of superposition, i.e. by summing up the field due to many small segments.


# 3 | Ampere's Law
