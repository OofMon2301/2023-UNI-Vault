## Preliminary Revision

### Kirchhoff's Circuit Law

Using Kirchoff's Circuit Law, we can calculate and solve for the currents and voltages around any given closed circuit providing we know the values of the electrical components.

#### Kirchhoff's Current Law
[[Kirchhoff's Current Law|Kirchhoff's Current Law]], or KCL: ![[Kirchhoff's Current Law#^3185b6]]
This is also commonly known as the *Conservation of Charge.* In a case where currents $I_{1},I_{2},I_{3}$ are travelling into the node, and currents $I_{4}$ and $I_{5}$ travelling out of the node, the equation would look like this:
$$
I_{1}+I_{2}+I_{3}-I_{4}-I_{5}=0.
$$
$$
I_{1}+I_{2}+I_{3}-(I_{4}+I_{5})=0
$$
#### Kirchhoff's Voltage Law

Starting at any point in the loop, continue in the *same direction* in a circle.

> Note that it does not matter too much which direction you start with (anti-clockwise or clockwise). It is more important to maintain the same direction that you start with.
