#ELEC2300

# Coulombs Law

$$
 F = k \, \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}_{12}}
$$
We need to remember that 
$$
k=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} = 8.99\times 10^9
$$
[[Coulomb's Law]] only applies to point charges in a field (whether it be empty or an [[Lecture 1.2 - Electric Fields|electric field]]).

In this case, the force applied in the equation is a *scalar*, not a [[Vector|vector]]. To redefine into a [[Vector|vector]]:
$$
\vec{F}_{12} = \frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}_{12} \times \hat{r}_{12}
$$
