# Electric Dipoles

## Elementary Definition
---
Point particles with electric charge are referred to as [[Point Charges|point charges]]. Two point charges, one with charge $+q$ and the other one with charge $-q$ separated by a distance $d$, constitute with an *electric dipole*. For this case, the electric dipole moment has a [[Magnitude|magnitude]]
$$
p=qd
$$
and is directed from the negative charge to the positive one.

A stronger mathematical definition is to use [[Vector|vector]], since a quantity with [[Magnitude|magnitude]] and direction, like the dipole moment of two point charges, can be expressed in vector form
$$
\mathbf{p} = q\mathbf{d}
$$
where $\mathbf{d}$ if the displacement vector pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge. The electric dipole moment vector $\mathbf{p}$ also points from the negative charge to the positive charge.
