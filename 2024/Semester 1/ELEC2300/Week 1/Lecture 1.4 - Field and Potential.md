# Electric Field and Line Integral
- The [[electric field]] is fundamentally connected to a line integral.
- To evaluate this, a path that connects point A to point B is chosen, and whether the [[electric field]] lies in the direction of the path or at some angle is determined.
- The dot product of the [[electric field]] and the path is calculated based on the angle between them, and all these contributions are added up into one large quantity, which turns into an integral.

# Special Cases for Line Integral
- For a small distance, the [[electric field]] can be assumed to be constant, and the change in potential is equal to the component of the field in the direction of the path times the distance moved.
- If the path is always tangent to the field, the dot product of the [[electric field]] and the path reduces to the [[magnitude]] times the distance, and the line integral turns into an ordinary integral.
- If the path is perpendicular to the field, the dot product is zero, and the change in potential is zero.

# Calculating Change in Potential
- The formula for calculating the change in potential if the [[electric field]] is known involves integrating the field to get to the potential.
- If we want to go from potential to field, a derivative is taken, and the field can be written as a derivative of the potential.
- The [[electric field]] in the direction of s is equal to the change in potential as we move in that direction, which tells us the [[electric field]] component in that direction.
