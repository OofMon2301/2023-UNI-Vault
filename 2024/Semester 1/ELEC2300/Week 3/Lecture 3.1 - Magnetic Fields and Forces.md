# Magnetic Fields

Magnetic fields are vector fields that describe the magnetic influence of electric currents and magnetic materials. They arise from the motion of electric charges and exert forces on other moving charges. Magnetic fields are distinct from electric fields, but they are closely related as part of the combined electromagnetic force.

## Definition and Units

The magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is defined in terms of the force $\vec{F}$ it exerts on a moving charge $q$ with velocity $\vec{v}$:

$$\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$$

The units of $\vec{B}$ are Teslas (T), where 1 T = 1 N/(AÂ·m). A more common unit is the Gauss (G), with 1 G = 10^-4 T.

## Properties of Magnetic Fields

- Magnetic fields are vector fields with both magnitude and direction.
- The direction of $\vec{B}$ is tangent to the magnetic field lines at any point.
- Magnetic field lines form closed loops (unlike electric field lines which begin and end on charges).
- Magnetic fields obey the principle of superposition, where the total field is the vector sum of individual fields.

## Sources of Magnetic Fields

- Moving electric charges (currents) create magnetic fields.
- Permanent magnets contain atomic currents that produce magnetic fields.
- The Earth itself has a magnetic field of around 10^-5 T due to currents in its molten core.

## Magnetic Force on a Moving Charge

The magnetic force $\vec{F}$ on a charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec{v}$ in a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is given by:

$$\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$$

- The force is perpendicular to both $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{B}$ (from the cross product).
- The force is maximum when $\vec{v}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{B}$.
- The force is zero when $\vec{v}$ is parallel to $\vec{B}$.

## Combined Electric and Magnetic Forces

If both an electric field $\vec{E}$ and magnetic field $\vec{B}$ are present, the total force $\vec{F}$ on a moving charge $q$ with velocity $\vec{v}$ is the vector sum:

$$\vec{F} = q\vec{E} + q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$$

Electric and magnetic fields are distinct but deeply connected phenomena that constitute the unified electromagnetic force.
