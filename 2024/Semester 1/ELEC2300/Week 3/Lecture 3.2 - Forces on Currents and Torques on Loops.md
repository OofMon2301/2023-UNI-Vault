#ELEC2300
# Magnetic Force on Current-Carrying Wires

## Current and Drift Velocity
An electric current $I$ through a conductor of cross-sectional area $A$ consists of charge carriers (e.g., electrons) moving with a drift velocity $v_d$. The current is related to these quantities by:

$$I = nev_dA$$

where $n$ is the charge carrier density, and $e$ is the fundamental charge (e.g., electron charge $\approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C).

## Force on a Current-Carrying Wire Segment
The magnetic force $d\vec{F}$ on a small segment $d\vec{l}$ of a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ is given by:

$$d\vec{F} = Id\vec{l} \times \vec{B}$$

This expression is analogous to the force $\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$ on a moving charge $q$ with velocity $\vec{v}$.

## Total Force on a Current-Carrying Wire
The total force $\vec{F}$ on a wire carrying current $I$ and having a shape defined by the vector path $\vec{l}$ is the vector sum of the forces on all segments:

$$\vec{F} = \int Id\vec{l} \times \vec{B}$$

For a wire lying in a plane, the force is perpendicular to the plane.

## Torque on a Current Loop
If the wire forms a closed loop of area $A$ with current $I$, the torque $\vec{\tau}$ about the loop's centre is:

$$\vec{\tau} = IA\vec{n} \times \vec{B}$$

where $\vec{n}$ is the normal vector to the loop's plane, determined by the right-hand grip rule.

The magnetic dipole moment $\vec{\mu}$ of the current loop is defined as:

$$\vec{\mu} = IA\vec{n}$$

Such that the torque can be written as:

$$\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$$

This is analogous to the torque on an electric dipole in an electric field.

## Applications
The torque on current loops forms the basis for the operation of electric motors, which convert electrical energy into rotational mechanical energy through the interaction of current loops with magnetic fields.
