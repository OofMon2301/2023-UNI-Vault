#ELEC2300

# Some Formula Maybe not on the Formula Sheet

$$
\vec{E}_{dipole} = -\frac{2kqd}{x^{2}}
$$
# 2.2 - Parallel Plate Capacitor

> [!note]
> Uniform field if not close to 'ends' of the capacitor. Generally ignore the *fringing* (the magnetic fields from the side of the capcitor).

$$
\nabla V_{ba} = V_{b}-V_{a} = -\int _{A}^B \vec{E} \cdot \, dl 
$$
If we move one of the parallel plate further and further away, the electric field strength will be the same.
$$
C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}

$$
$$
\Delta V = \frac{Qd}{At}
$$
Adding these together gives
$$
C = \frac{At}{d}
$$
# 2.4 Dielectrics and Electric Susceptibility

$\vec{E}_{total} = \vec{E}_{induced} + \vec{E}_{0}$
$E_{0}$ is the initial field (external field).

$$
K = \frac{E_{0}}{}
$$
$$
\Delta V = \frac{\Delta V_{0}}{K}
$$
