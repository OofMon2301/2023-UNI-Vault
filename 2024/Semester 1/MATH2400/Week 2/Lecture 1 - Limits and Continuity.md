# Limits and Continuity

Recall that $\lim_{ n \to \infty }x_{n}=L$ if $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists M \st n>M \implies |x_{n}-x| < \epsilon$.

## Proposition
A converged sequence is bounded.

## Proof
Suppose $\lim_{ n \to \infty }x_{n}=x$
Take $\epsilon = 1.$ By definition, $\exists M$ such that if $n>M$ then $|x_{n}-x|<1$
