#CSSE2010

# Digital Logic
Only *two* logical levels present (i.e. binary)
- Logic "0" - where usually small voltages (around 0 volts) occur
- Logic "1" - where usually larger voltage (around 0.8 to 5 volts, depending on the "logic family", i.e. transistors) occur.

## Logic Gates
[[Logic Gates]] are the building blocks of computers, where each gate has one or more inputs, and always have one output.
These [[Logic Gates|Logic Gates]] perform logic operations (or functions) that consist of 7 basic types:
1. NOT
2. AND
3. OR
4. NAND
5. NOR
6. XOR
7. XNOR
Inputs and outputs can really only have two states: 1 & 0. This can also be expressed as "true" and "false".

![[Pasted image 20240229135015.png|XOR is the odd function and XNOR is the even function. When $A+B=2k$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, then TRUE.]]

# Boolean Logic Functions

Logic functions can be expressed as expressions involving variables (such as $A,B,C, \dots, Z$), and functions (such as $+, \cdot, \circ$).

Rules about how this works are called **Boolean algebra**.
Variables and functions can only take on values of 0 or 1.
