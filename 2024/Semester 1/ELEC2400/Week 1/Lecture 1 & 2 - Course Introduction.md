## Revision Of Circuit Theory
### Passive Reference Configuration

This results in the current entering the positive terminal of the voltage.

### Kirchhoff's Laws

There are two Kirchhoff's Laws; [[Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] and [[Kirchhoff's Current Law]].

### Series and Parallel Circuits

### Independent and Dependent Sources

There are many independent and dependent voltage and current sources, depending on the components that control each part.

#### Dependent Voltage Sources

Dependent Voltage Sources (also known as controlled voltage sources) are represented by diamond shaped symbols. The **voltage** across a **dependent voltage source** depends on the current or voltage that appears elsewhere in the circuit.
