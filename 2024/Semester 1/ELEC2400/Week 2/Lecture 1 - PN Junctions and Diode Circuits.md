#### What are Semiconductors?

Semiconductors are a solid substance that has a conductivity between that of an insulator and that of most metals.

The three most frequent semiconductors used are made of Germanium (**Ge**), Silicon (**Si**), and Gallium Arsenide (**GaAs**).

Germanium was the first material used in diodes and transistors. 

In 1954, the first Silicon transistor was introduced, it had the capabilities of the Germanium transistor, but with improved temperature sensitivity, allowing for it to work for extended periods of time without reaching higher temperatures.

In the 70's, the first Gallium Arsenide transistor was used. This semiconductor was used primarily as it was much more suitable for its high speed and efficiency.
