# [[Product Rule]]

# Definition of Product Rule:
*Created on 23:09 11-01-2024

In [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"), the **product rule** (or **Leibniz rule**or **Leibniz product rule**) is a formula used to find the [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of products of two or more [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functions_(mathematics) "Functions (mathematics)"). For two functions, it may be stated in [Lagrange's notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Lagrange's_notation "Notation for differentiation") as

( u ⋅ v ) ′ = u ′ ⋅ v + u ⋅ v ′

![{\displaystyle (u\cdot v)'=u'\cdot v+u\cdot v'}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af29b8270711bcbb0f0950b1fe5af1967b17cf5f)

or in [Leibniz's notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%27s_notation "Leibniz's notation") as

d d x ( u ⋅ v ) = d u d x ⋅ v + u ⋅ d v d x .

![{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dx}}(u\cdot v)={\frac {du}{dx}}\cdot v+u\cdot {\frac {dv}{dx}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/808f4fede6066e704904310b27ee786192dba4c7)

The rule may be extended or generalized to products of three or more functions, to a rule for higher-order derivatives of a product, and to other contexts.
