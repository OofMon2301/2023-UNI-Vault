In the study of [heat transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer "Heat transfer"), **Newton's law of cooling** is a [physical law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law") which states that

> The rate of [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat "Heat") loss of a body is directly proportional to the difference in the [temperatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") between the body and its environment.

The law is frequently qualified to include the condition that the [temperature difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_gradient "Temperature gradient") is small and the nature of heat transfer mechanism remains the same. As such, it is equivalent to a statement that the [heat transfer coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer_coefficient "Heat transfer coefficient"), which mediates between heat losses and temperature differences, is a constant.

In [heat conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction "Thermal conduction"), Newton's Law is generally followed as a consequence of [Fourier's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction#Fourier.27s_law "Thermal conduction"). The [thermal conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity "Thermal conductivity") of most materials is only weakly dependent on temperature, so the constant heat transfer coefficient condition is generally met. In [convective heat transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_(heat_transfer) "Convection (heat transfer)"), Newton's Law is followed for forced air or pumped fluid cooling, where the properties of the fluid do not vary strongly with temperature, but it is only approximately true for buoyancy-driven convection, where the velocity of the flow increases with temperature difference. In the case of heat transfer by [thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation "Thermal radiation"), Newton's law of cooling holds only for very small temperature differences.

When stated in terms of temperature differences, Newton's law (with several further simplifying assumptions, such as a low [Biot number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot_number "Biot number") and a temperature-independent [heat capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity "Heat capacity")) results in a simple [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") expressing temperature-difference as a [function of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_time "Function of time"). The solution to that equation describes an exponential decrease of temperature-difference over time. This characteristic decay of the temperature-difference is also associated with Newton's law of cooling.
