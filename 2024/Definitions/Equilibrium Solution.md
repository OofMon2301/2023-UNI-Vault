# [[Equilibrium Solution]]

# Definition of Equilibrium Solution:
*Created on 21:29 09-01-2024

An *equilibrium solution* is a constant solution $y(t)=c$ to the [[ODE]]
$$
\frac{dy}{dt}=f(t,y)
$$
The graph of an equilibrium solution is a horizontal line. Such a line has a slope of zero, i.e., $y'=0$. This can only happen if $f(t,y)=0$ has a solution $y=c$ for some real constant $c$.
