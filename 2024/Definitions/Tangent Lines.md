In [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry"), the **tangent line** (or simply **tangent**) to a plane [curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") at a given [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") is, intuitively, the [straight line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line "Straight line") that "just touches" the curve at that point. [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz "Leibniz") defined it as the line through a pair of [infinitely close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal "Infinitesimal") points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is tangent to the curve _y_ = _f_(_x_) at a point _x_ = _c_ if the line passes through the point (_c_, _f_(_c_)) on the curve and has [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") _f_'(_c_), where _f_' is the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative "Derivative") of _f_. A similar definition applies to [space curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_curve "Space curve") and curves in _n_-dimensional [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space "Euclidean space").
