# [[Euler's Method]]

*Created on 21:58 09-01-2024

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") and [computational science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science "Computational science"), the **Euler method** (also called the **forward Euler method**) is a first-order [numerical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis") procedure for solving [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") (ODEs) with a given [initial value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem "Initial value problem"). It is the most basic [explicit method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_and_implicit_methods "Explicit and implicit methods") for [numerical integration of ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_ordinary_differential_equations "Numerical ordinary differential equations") and is the simplest [Runge–Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_method "Runge–Kutta method"). The Euler method is named after [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler "Leonhard Euler"), who first proposed it in his book _[Institutionum calculi integralis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutionum_calculi_integralis "Institutionum calculi integralis")_ (published 1768–1770).

### Purpose and why it works

Consider the problem of calculating the shape of an unknown curve which starts at a given point and satisfies a given differential equation. Here, a differential equation can be thought of as a formula by which the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope "Slope") of the [tangent line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line "Tangent line") to the curve can be computed at any point on the curve, once the position of that point has been calculated.
