# [[Electric Field]]

# Definition of Electric Field:
*Created on 10:25 26-02-2024

An electric field is a [[vector]] field that shows the direction that a positively charged particle will move when placed in the field. More precisely, if a particle has an electric charge $q$ and is in an electric field $\vec{E}$, the electric force the charge will feel is $\vec{F}=q \cdot \vec{E}$.
Electric fields are caused by electric charges, described by Gauss's law, or varying magnetic fields, described by Faraday's law of induction. The equations of both fields are coupled and together form Maxwell's equations that describe both fields as a function of charges and currents.
