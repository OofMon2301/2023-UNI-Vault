*Created on 10:37 30-11-2023

An equation containing a function $y$ of a *single* independent variable $x$, as well as derivatives of the function. An equation of the form
 $$
f\left( x, y, \frac{dy}{dx}, \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}, \dots, \frac{d^ny}{dx^n} \right) = 0
$$
is called an ODE of order $n$. Here $f$ encodes a relationship between $x$ and $y$ and some of its derivatives.
