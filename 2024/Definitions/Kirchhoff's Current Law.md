*Created on 13:08 20-02-2024

Kirchhoff's Current Law states that the “_total current or charge entering a junction or node is exactly equal to the charge leaving the node as it has no other place to go except to leave, as no charge is lost within the node_“. In other words the algebraic sum of ALL the currents entering and leaving a node must be equal to zero. ^3185b6
$$
I_{\text{exiting}}+I_{\text{entering}} =0
$$
In other words:
$$
I_{in}+I_{out}=0.
$$
