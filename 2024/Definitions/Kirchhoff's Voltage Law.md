# [[Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]]

# Definition of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law:
*Created on 13:07 20-02-2024


Kirchhoff's Voltage Law States that “_in any closed loop network being driven by a voltage source, the total voltage around the loop is equal to the sum of all the voltage drops within the same loop_” which is equal to zero. In other words the algebraic sum of all voltage sources and voltage drops within a closed loop must be equal to zero since the algebraic sum of the voltage drops equals the algebraic sum of the voltage sources. ^c69787
