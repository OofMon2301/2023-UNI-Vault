**Capacitance** is a measure of the amount of electric charge that can be stored for a given electric potential. It is the ratio of the charge $Q$ on either conductor or "plate" of a capacitor to the potential difference $\Delta V$ between the conductors:

$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$

The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F), where 1 farad = 1 coulomb/volt.

Capacitance depends on the geometry and dimensions of the conductors, as well as the permittivity $\epsilon$ of the insulating material between them. For a parallel plate capacitor with plate area $A$ and separation distance $d$:

$$C = \epsilon \frac{A}{d}$$

A larger capacitance allows more charge to be stored per unit of applied potential difference. Capacitors exploit this ability to store electric charge and energy in the electric field between the conductors.
