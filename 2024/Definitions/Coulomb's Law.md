*Created on 10:16 26-02-2024

Coulomb's law is a function developed in the 1780s by physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. It explains how strong the force will be between two electrostatic charges. Electrostatic means electric charges without any motion.

## Scale
---
Coulomb's law explains the scale between two electric charges. The scale of electrostatic force follows the function below.

$$
F=K_{c} \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$
Coulomb's law explains that the force scale F is relative to ratio of $q_{1}, q_{2}, \frac{1}{r^{2}}$.

While $K_{c}$ remains constant, when multiples of $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ become bigger, the *electrostatic force* will also get bigger. When the distance $r$ becomes bigger, the electrostatic force will become smaller by the ratio of $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$.
