Sir Isaac Newton’s second law of motion is a fundamental principle that describes the relationship between an object’s mass, the forces acting upon it, and its acceleration. It is succinctly expressed in the equation:

$$
F=ma
$$

Where:

- ( F ) represents the net force applied to the object,
- ( m ) denotes the mass of the object,
- ( a ) signifies the acceleration of the object.

This law posits that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The direction of the acceleration is in the direction of the applied net force.

To elaborate, the net force (( F )) is the [[vector]] sum of all the forces acting on the object. When multiple forces are present, their [[vector]] sum must be calculated, taking into account both the [[magnitude]] and direction of each individual force. The resulting net force then determines the acceleration of the object according to the proportionality constant of the object’s mass.

In a more sophisticated form, Newton’s second law can be articulated as:

$$
\vec{a}=\frac{{\sum \vec{F}}}{m}
$$

Here, ( $\vec{a}$ ) is the acceleration [[vector]], ( $\sum \vec{F}$ ) is the [[vector]] sum of all forces (also known as the net force), and ( $m$ ) is the mass of the object. This [[vector]] equation indicates that the acceleration of an object not only depends on the [[magnitude]] of the net force but also on its direction.

The second law is a cornerstone in classical mechanics and provides the quantitative means to calculate the motion of objects when subjected to various force conditions.
