A **parallel plate capacitor** is a device consisting of two parallel conductive plates separated by a distance $d$, with opposite charges $+Q$ and $-Q$ on each plate. It is a simple model used to study the behavior of capacitors and electric fields.

When the plates are large compared to their separation, a uniform electric field $\vec{E}$ is established between them, directed from the positive to the negative plate. The field strength $|\vec{E}|$ is proportional to the charge density $\sigma = Q/A$ (where $A$ is the plate area) and inversely proportional to the permittivity $\epsilon$ of the medium between the plates.

The potential difference $\Delta V$ between the plates is given by $\Delta V = Ed$, and the capacitance $C = Q/\Delta V = \epsilon A/d$ measures the amount of charge stored per unit voltage applied across the capacitor.

Parallel plate capacitors illustrate fundamental principles of electrostatics and are widely used in electrical circuits, energy storage, and various applications involving capacitance.
