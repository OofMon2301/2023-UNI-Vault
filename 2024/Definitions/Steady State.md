# [[Steady State]]

# Definition of Steady State:
*Created on 10:27 26-02-2024

In [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory "Systems theory"), a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System") or a [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_theory "Process theory") is in a **steady state** if the variables (called [state variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_variable "State variable")) which define the behavior of the system or the process are unchanging in time.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state#cite_note-:0-1) In [continuous time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_time "Continuous time"), this means that for those properties _p_ of the system, the [partial derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative "Partial derivative") with respect to time is zero and remains so:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = 0 \text{  for all present and future } t.
$$
