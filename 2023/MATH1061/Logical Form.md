### Inclusive and Exclusive *OR*
---
The symbol $\lor$ means "inclusive or:. So $p \lor q$ is true  when $p$ is true, or $q$ is true or both are true. Sometimes when the word "or" is used, the meaning is "one or the other, but not both".

This is "exclusive or". Exclusive *or* is often written using the logical connective

| f   | t   | t   |     |
| f   | t   | f   |     |
| f   | f   | t   |     |
