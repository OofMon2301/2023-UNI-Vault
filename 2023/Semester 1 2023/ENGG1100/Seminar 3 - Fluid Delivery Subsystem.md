## Fluid Delivery - the Fire Triangle

A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in the fire triangle:
- Oxygen
- Heat
- Fuel

For example: Gas stove

The goal is to transport water from your vehicle to the 'fire' to remove heat.

## Pressure

[[2023/Definitions/Pressure|Pressure]]  is measured by bar.

## Fluid Delivery

Pushing water through a pipe system requires energy to overcome friction and lift water (push against gravity)

## Energy

A pump feeds energy ([[Pressure]]) into the flow of fluid

$$
p_{A}+\frac{1}{2}pU^{2}_{A}+pgz_{A}+\text{pump energy}=p_{B}+\frac{1}{2}pU^{2}_{B}+pgz_{B}+friction \ losses
$$


Bernoulli's principle: 
$$
fluid \ velocity \propto \frac{1}{pressure}
$$

## Pumps
There are two types of pumps: Dynamic pumps and Positive Displacement Pumps.

Dynamic Pumps allow handling through dynamic forces. They pump the liquid using a type of spinning element. A rotating shaft generates dynamic forces. They use centrifugal force to generate pressure for fluid motion. 

It requires priming - pump must be submerged in water prior to operation.


Positive Displacement Pumps is a reciprocating or rotary motion of pistons, plungers, diaphragms to transport fluid. The fluid discharge is in pulses. It operates at a higher efficiency at increasing pressure.



### Things to Know

Know the technical specifications of your pumps (components)

- What are they used for?
- What are your system requirements?
- what are limitations?

## Other Components to Think about

### Resovioir

Shape, volume, location of pump, (immersible, subersible, outside), material, and insulation/preventing leakage.

### Tubing / Piping

Inner/outer diameter, material, robustness, heat resistance, flexibility, cost, leakage
