## 9.1 Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integrals

A function $F$ is called an *antiderivative* of $f$ on an interval $I$ if $F'(x)=f(x)$ for all $x \in I$.

For example, 
$$
F(x)=2x^{3} \text{ is an antiderivative of }f(x)-6x^{2}
$$ 
for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ since $F'(x)=6x^{2}=f(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. However, $F(x)=2x^{3}+10$ is also an antiderivative of $f(x)=6x^{2}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
