# [[Chapter 3 - Applications of Vectors]]
#MATH1050

Now that we are familiar with the different representations of vectors, we can investigate some of the ways vectors are used to solve mathematical problems.

In pure mathematics, vectors can be used to solve problems in geometry.

In applied mathematics, vectors can be used to model quantities such as displacement, velocity, or forces acting on an object, and thus answer questions about such vector quantities.

There are two operations on vectors, the scalar product and the vector product, that also have useful applications.
