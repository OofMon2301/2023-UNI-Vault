# [[Chapter 7 - Functions]]
#MATH1050
# Notes

A function is a rule that associates a unique output to each input.

Functions are used heavily in all areas of mathematics and in most applications of mathematics.

Some examples of functions include:
- A formula that converts temperature in Fahrenheit to temperature in Celcius, $c=\frac{5}{9}(f-32)$, describes temperature in degrees centigrade as a function of temperature in degree Fahrenheit .
- A formula for the area of a circle in terms of its radius, $A=\pi r^{2}$, describes area as a function of radius.
- A table of values that given the human population of the world for each year from 1900 to 2000 describes population as a function of year.

Topics in this sections are:
- Introduction to functions
- A collection of standard functions
- Solving inequalities
- Composition of functions
- Inverse functions
- Limits of functions

## 7.1 Introduction to Functions

A *function* is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $A$ exactly one element from a set $B$.
