## Vectors

A *[[2023/Definitions/Vector|Vector]] quantity is something whose specification requires **both** a magnitude and a direction.

Normally, when writing vectors, a lower case letter, with the tilde (~) symbol below it, for example, $\large \underline{v}$. 

### Geometric representation of a vector
---
A vector can be represented geometrically in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ by an arrow.

The length of the arrow represents the *magnitude* of the vector, and the *direction* of the vector is indicated by the direction the arrow is pointing.

The actual location of the arrow in the diagram is irrelevant, only its magnitude and direction matter.

If $P$ and $Q$ are points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$, then $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ denotes the vector from $P$ to $Q$. The point $P$ is the tail of the vector and the point $Q$ is the head of the vector.

#### Matrix representation of a vector

For a (geometric) vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$ with tail at the point $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and head at the point $(x_{2},y_{2})$, the matrix form of the vector has 2 rows and 1 column and is written as:
