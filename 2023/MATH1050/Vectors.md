## Vectors

A *vector* quantity is something whose specification requires **both** a magnitude and a direction.

Normally, when writing vectors, a lower case letter, with the tilde (~) symbol below it, for example, $\large \underline{v}$. 

### Geometric representation of a vector
A vector can be represented geometrically in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ by an arrow.

The length of the arrow represents the *magnitude* of the vector, and the *direction*
