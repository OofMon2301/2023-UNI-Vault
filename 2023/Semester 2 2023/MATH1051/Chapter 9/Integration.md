## 9.1 Antiderivatives

A function $F$ is called an *antiderivative* of $f$ on an interval $I$ if
$$
F'(x) = f(x), \quad \text{ for all }x \in I.
$$

## 9.5 Volume of Revolution

Suppose $f(x)$ is positive and continuous on $[a,b]$. By rotating the graph of $f(x)$ above $[a,b]$ about the $x$-axis, we obtain a cylindrical solid. What is the volume of such a solid? This is what we call a *volume of revolution*.

### 9.5.1 Formula for the volume of revolution

Suppose $f(x)\geq 0$ and continuous on $[a,b]$. The volume of revolution of the solid obtained by rotating the graph $y=f(x)$ above $[a,b]$ about the $x$-axis is:
$$
\mathbf{V}=\pi \int ^b_{a} [f(x)]^{2} \, dx 
$$
