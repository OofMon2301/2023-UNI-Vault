Calculating the operating conditions (voltage, current) of an electric circuit, including:

- DC Circuits, where currents and voltages are constant.
- AC Circuits, where currents and voltages vary with time.
- These include:
	- AC power supply circuits,
	- Multimedia signals such as audio and video represented by time-varying voltages.

> [!question] Challenge
> To critically think about:
> - The functionality and design of electrical systems.
> - How electrical systems interact with the physical world and other engienering systems.
> - The role of electrical systems in society
> 

> [!note] Modes of Enhancement
>  **IN PERSON**: This course will have an on-campus lecture and 4-hours (2 of 2 hour) of on-campus practical classes per week; and you will be required to attend the UQ campus.
